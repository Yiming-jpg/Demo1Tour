            <p>The venue page of our music society website showcases two locations on the TARUMT 
        campus where we host our events - the Dewan Tunku Abdul Rahman (DTAR) and the Sports Complex.
        The DTAR is our primary event space, and it's where we hold most of our performances. This venue can 
        accommodate a large audience and provides excellent acoustics, ensuring that our music is heard clearly. 
        On the other hand, the Sports Complex is a versatile space that we use for smaller events, such as workshops 
        and rehearsals. We also provide essential details about the venues, including their location on campus, 
        parking facilities, and accessibility. This page serves as a guide for our members and visitors to help 
        them navigate our event spaces and enjoy our performances fully.</p>
